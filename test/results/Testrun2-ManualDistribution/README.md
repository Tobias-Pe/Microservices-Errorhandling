# Test Scenario

- Distribution more manually by using "placement.constraints"

## Results

CPU-Node:

- discrepancy between the utilization of the nodes has decreased
- better utilization of the available resources

Also, this version in which more has been distributed manually will further stabilize test results because the distribution is more consistent
